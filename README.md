# DSD Coursework

## Task 1

- Installed Quartus Lite 20.1 using [this guide](https://mil.ufl.edu/3701/docs/quartus/quartus22.1_installation.pdf).
  - Needed to install a gtk-type package, no issue via pacman, fiddled with locales to activate `en_US` although this was not required, added to path by adding in `.bashrc` 

- Installed Eclipse using [this guide](https://www.terasic.com.tw/wiki/Getting_Start_Install_Eclipse_IDE_into_Nios_EDS)
  - Missing gtk package, installed via pacman
  - Issue related to missing definition of a freetype function, resolution is to disable the default quartus bundled version of freetype at `~/intelFPGA_lite/20.1/quartus/linux64/jre64/lib/amd64/libfreetypeso.6`.
- Blasted to board, no issues, but would not upload with `nios2-download-elf`, saying device not responding. After trying to use Eclipse IDE to run as NIOS II hardware, I see the System ID error as mentioned in the documentation. I realised my top level wires were overlapping and not actually connected. After properly connecting them, I recompiled, blasted and was able to run `nios2-download-elf` and see `Hello from NIOS II!` on the terminal.
- Finally, I created an alias in my `.bashrc` to invoke `nios2_command_shell.sh` with `shell`. Then tested compiling and flashing the program directly from VSCode using `make download-elf`. After an initial issue with a wrong timestampâ€½ which required me to recompile the entire project, I was able to successfully flash without using the Eclipse IDE. Also tested changing the program to ensure it was not using a cached result.
